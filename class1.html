            <p class="lg:w-1/2 w-full">Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit.'temple of the God of the
                field') is a Hindu temple, one of the twelve jyotirlinga of Shiva. The temple is located on the Garhwal
                Himalayan range[1] near the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather
                conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritiya)
                and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) of the
                temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a
                homogeneous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the historical name of the region.[2]

                The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres (14 mi) uphill
                trek from Gaurikund. Pony, mule and manchan service is available to reach the temple. According to Hindu
                legends, the temple was initially built by the Pandavas, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the
                holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva.[1] The Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in
                Kedarnath.[1][3] The temple is one of the four major sites in India's Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of
                Northern Himalayas and is the first of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites. This temple is the highest
                among the 12 Jyotirlingas.[4] It is one of the 275 paadal petra sthalams expounded in the Tevaram, a
                sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during the 6th and 7th centuries by 63 saints called Nayanars. This
                temple is sung of by Thirugnanasambandar, Appar, Sundarar and Sekkizhar in their Tevaram texts.

            <p>The Ram Mandir (lit.'Rama Temple') is a partially constructed Hindu temple complex in Ayodhya, Uttar
                Pradesh, India.[6][7] Many Hindus believe that it is located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the
                mythical birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism.[8][9][10] The temple was inaugurated[7] on
                22 January 2024 after a prana pratishtha (consecration) ceremony.[6][10] On the first day of its
                opening, following the consecration, the temple received a rush of over half a million visitors,[11] and
                after a month, the average number of visitors was reported to be "1 to 1.5 lakh on a daily basis".[12]

                The site of the temple has been the subject of communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims in India, as
                it is the former location of the Babri Masjid mosque, which was built between 1528 and 1529. The idols
                of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in
                1992.[13][14][15] In 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to
                Hindus for construction of a temple, while Muslims were given land nearby in Dhannipur in Ayodhya to
                construct a mosque.[16] The court referenced a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as
                evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath the demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to
                be non-Islamic.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the best place to get a firsthand experience of Ujjains timekeeping techniques is the Vedshala
                (Observatory), now called the Government Jiwaji Observatory. We got there early, and as the call of
                peacocks rent the morning air, observatory guide Piyush Nikam deconstructed for us Ujjains obsession
                with time.
                As per the Surya Siddhanta, a 4th-century astronomical treatise, Ujjain is geographically situated at
                the precise spot where the zero meridian of longitude and the Tropic of Cancer intersect. This is why it
                was considered the navel of the earth, and is called the “Greenwich of India”.On a large globe outside
                the Ujjain Vedshala we see Ujjains location pinpointed on the Tropic of Cancer. The Tropic of Cancer is
                significant because, as the earth revolves around the sun, this latitude marks the northernmost position
                at which the sun can be seen directly overhead. The Tropic of Cancer crosses the spire of Mahakal Temple
                in Ujjain, as it does the Somnath Temple in Gujarat. This imaginary line is also said to pass through
                Ujjains temple of Mangalnath, considered in Hindu cosmogony to be the birthplace of Mangal (Mars) and
                the closest point from Earth to Mars, explained Piyush.
